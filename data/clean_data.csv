742,for me it just that the writing falls apart season of dexter is awesome and it seems it reasonably based on the book season deviates but it still pretty good television imo think the issue going forward is that basically all the really major antagonists are dead by the end of season so they have to start making stuff up even moreso than usual by the time dexter has kid thought the show was already dead it went from an interesting look into moral serial killer to more cliched sitcom now there baby schtick do not get me wrong think there are still some decent if not outright good episodes after but even so think season is the highlight and you ve pretty much seen all the best of the show by the end of season,0,0,0,0.1101322536076014
743,it depends on your maturity it took me long time to realize was even in that phase to begin with you re already seeing the situation as problem which is definitely step in the right direction in my case was basically told that my iq was high by my therapist figured in my juvenile stupidity that meant that was automatically better than everyone else put lot of value in my mind and the result was basically fortress of pride ve since become much less prideful about my work especially the things do with my mind but the foundation of that fortress is still there professional help is probably more reliable than some random guys on reddit but can say that found being able to laugh at myself to be incredibly helpful after told myself was better than everyone else felt like had to actually be better than everyone else this is one of the main reasons not huge fan of sports was not good at them so therefore they must be stupid being able bring my faults to conversation in way that would benefit the group was my first step toward becoming less iamverysmart it started with being able to identify my own shortcomings and coming to terms with them always going to be short person and regardless of how much it may hurt my self esteem making casual jokes about that has brought laughter to lot of people still trying to make up for the damages ve caused and know that most likely not going to be able to fix all of the problems that pride has created ve been blessed to have family and friends that support me but it struggle to keep myself humble even now feel like crossing some lines which is evidence of my continuing growth dunno guess all that to say we re all human and despite how awesome you think you are you re going to make mistakes take life less seriously and give yourself moment to stop and smell the flowers on the way you may have to stoop down to do it but you ll be glad you did in the end,0,0,0,1.9825865380329215

2447,honestly andywinds when the slaves were brought over here to the usa they came from many different countries and tribes in africa their cultures were almost as diverse as the cultures that we have now here and the truth is most of our history was wiped away through slavery acting and being anything but white was discouraged and many people died from it they did whatever they had to do to survive so if that meant shaving their hair making it straight stopping the spread of their native language bleaching the skin the list goes on how this is relevant is that at the time is that to differentiate between the darks and lights black people were called well black and white people were called you get my drift this is only in the united states of america black itself has different connotations all across the world so you will get different responses when you are calling someone from brazil black person compared to someone from canada or the united states you ll notice that pretty much everyone who considers themselves to be black will also acknowledge that they have lot of african ancestry down the line though there the fact that africa is also an incredibly huge continent and there are also white africans so one would be under the assumption that if white person from africa comes to the usa that their race would be african american but the reality is that they will still be called white american it all based on looks it an incredibly huge socially constructed value here in the usa about african american well you can not tell whether someone is african american or not just by looking at them some people might be from nigeria an african country so they might call themselves nigerian american after they get their citizenship there are over countries in africa sure you can imagine the confusion this can cause people form other countries simply will not get it because race is social construct and yet it still means so much this is why black is kind of word that we can all agree on here in the us no matter if we are jamaican somalian canadian american brazilian whatever we can kind of agree with it you can add racial mixing to the mix and acknowledge that not all people who are dark skinned are completely black yet they are still forced to identify as only black for example my nephew is half puerto rican they are racially mixed with spanish taino african and half black so no matter what he identifies more with he will always be just black this makes lot of people mad specifically people who may be mixed with or even with different backgrounds because society will only see one part of them this can be sad for person who is mixed with black or not also the term negro itself is not offensive it literally means black in spanish portuguese and comes from the latin word niger which also means black believe it or not but at one point in time negro was the politically correct word of choice during the civil rights movement there was divide in black people about what our identity was because well it was wiped away from them some people wanted to get completely away from anything associated with the white people in america so they decided to make up new terms the white peoples names for them went like this colored negro and then there was divide where the black people themselves were divided in whether or not to choose from any of the following afro american black american and negro some people still wanted to identify with the continent of africa but understandably some grew up knowing nothing about where they were from with the white people treating you more harshly the more black african you identified with they wanted to stay away from it so basically you got people of all ages with different economical backgrounds some were mixed with white or were generally mixed looking or flat out white passing and different political views think the more violent malcom versus martin luther king jr trying to come up with the same end pov it has not happened and still has not happened nowadays youth will use the words interchangeably well except for negro and afro american because those just sound weird haha but you ll get the oldest black people still identifying with those outdated words with that said there are still organizations businesses and college funds that used the term negro in them so the word negro is completely okay when used for historical purposes when you see young black people calling other black people negros please know that of them are not serious they will look at you strange if you call them negros in the usa with that said here one of my favorite youtube videos about apologizing if someone says what you ve said offends them you do not really have to agree with everything she says but it great way to do damage control just call black people black and you should not ever have problem in north america can not help you with other parts of the continent or other continents because race means completely different things there but just be confident in your speaking and apologize even if you re thinking wtf how the ck could that offend you and try not to twitch and you ll be fine lol even ve had to do it re educate myself okay wow so am all over the world with my comment but hope that at least enlightened you little bit am sorry if something say is more confusing than it helps do hope that you will not be apprehensive about approaching us anymore though the more you acknowledge our differences and are okay with them the cooler we will think you are,0,0,0,0.4784100173851937

2832,ugh speeches if you re getting married soon or ever and you re trusting people to do speeches tell them they need to run it by someone who has social graces first never give speech at wedding without testing it out in front of people the initial bitch moment was my husband mistake but it triggered chain reaction that ll never forget it is burned into my brain no matter how hard try to think of the other great stuff it is stuck there my now husband made thank you for giving me this beautiful gift to unwrap joke to my parents in the middle of his speech no one laughed but no big deal really the rest of the speech was great and he was actually moved to tears so so were bunch of other people the rest of the speech was so good that it detracted from the awkwardness of the bad joke when bring this up get mixed responses some remember it and were quite shocked some do not remember at all or are lying to me to spare my feelings not sure anyway on to the actual bitch my sister did speech before this and she has had some challenges in life she diagnosed bipolar and had to be hospitalized once before that there was lot of self medicating with alcohol other substances and men when she went to deliver her speech was nervous but we had spoken beforehand and she did pretty heartfelt speech about me being her protector and alcohol supervisor etc she said lot about her partying and me giving good advice it was pg and was actually really proud of her fast forward to my husband joke he thanks my parents for the gift to unwrap barf in my mouth little awkward moment of silence follows and then my unstable idiot uncle shouts out you chose the wrong sister and starts to laugh that right folks my uncle referred to my sister as slut in front of my entire wedding party and my already embarrassed parents we never speak of this my uncle still comes to holiday events because everyone knows he has mental health issues and it not his fault same uncle was staying at hotel off site we did one of those weekend in the woods at resort dealies and there was not enough room for everyone on site he and his equally socially gifted wife decided they would join us for brunch the next day brunch was included in each onsite guest package and no one else was invited to join when they showed up and the staff explained that to them they asked to have their meals charged to my husband and my tab have no idea why the staff allowed this but it was on our bill when we left just to add salt to the wound his wife also moved bunch of the name tags on the tables around as though that was not thought out or important for the waitstaff my uncle was that bitch,1,0,0,2.0769378585186744

3843,have deep loathing for the weather channel it began with their sensationalism when comes to any kind of weather they have became professionals at nothing but crying wolf anytime any type of inclement whether is possible but it really blossomed into its current flower of contempt and disdain when they started naming winter weather the way the noaa names hurricanes and tropical storms apart from the fact that the two types of weather are massively different winter storms are the result of front usually stretching hundreds of miles long moving through an area whereas hurricanes and tropical storms are more localized individual events and thus their naming system implies that the weather will all be the same along that whole front it be like if sunshine was predicted so the talking head they put up says get ready because high pressure system asshat is just going to be dumping sunshine all over us it further offends me that their motivation in doing this is not to help people prepare for winter storm system but rather to monetize the weather finally can only assume that the noaa already has dibs on all the normal professional names so they have to use the stupid sensational ones so we get things like winter storm gandalf or winter storm goliath also work with orphaned and abandoned children in haiti this has nothing to do with the weather channel,1,0,0,0.01211974485450055

one little thing does not go right just stop you need to let us guys handle these things for the same amount of effort and few seconds of quick imagination we can come up with things that will blow your mind for example here what ve got planned for mine somewhere in the desert tractor trailers and buses begin rolling in and setting up massive infrastructure system that makes burning man look like couple hippies camped out under lean to food perishable supplies and guests are paradropped into the area from nearby cities to preserve freshness family members bridesmaids groomsmen and anyone involved with the actual marital function are also provided with the option of wingsuits and or jetpacks for their descent to help set the mood anyone not invited is still welcome to attend but must reach the location on their own barrier walls roughly meters in height are set up into the general shape of cathedral the size of an olympic arena with massive amphitheater at the core and the far end opened so that the festivity can be enjoyed by the rest of the gathering these barriers are adorned with relevant artwork of various forms on the inside and have enough protective backing to contain the average munitions dump demolition the outline of the cathedral is actually rather wide and serves to conceal the world largest array of custom pyrotechnic artillery in the distance behind the amphitheater there exists slender and tall roughly pyramid covered in mirrors with tracks on either side that allow both halves to separate as the sun sets and the event begins guests will enter very generous accommodations within the body of the roofless cathedral beds of pillows dining tables hot springs anything you can imagine and all entertainment events in the vicinity will cease so the rest of the crowd can approach the open end and spectate the activities as the last light fades away the stars vibrantly emerge and the milky way dominates the sky several science personalities take to the raised dais before the amphitheater now populated by the cream of the world symphony crop who begin to provide soothing and inspiring background music and host the world grandest planetarium experience while sharing message of hope and discovery as that transcendent experience comes to peaceful and fulfilling conclusion the dais is cleared and the bridesmaids groomsmen and relevant functionaries take the stage to the backing of sudden and tremendous fanfare from the orchestra behind them the most awesome woman in the world and take each other hand as we begin our halo jump from the aircraft above searchlights frantically scan the sky for our descent as air raid sirens go off it bit of trip down so we occupy ourselves with witty banter of the love you know and wow that pressure suit actually does make you look fat variety we open our shoots and begin performing acrobatics overhead while strafing the guests and even attendees outside the facility with pulsing laser pistols no harm do not worry as every speaker in the vicinity plays synchronized pew pew laser noises we land together in front of the dais remove the jump gear to reveal immaculate attire and ascend the stairs as some one off john williams piece plays then we put on our power rings press our fists together and say something along the lines of by our powers combined super umutuku temple of eternity activate our begins playing we ll totally know what it is by then and we reveal the true purpose of this fully armed and operational wedding station the pyrotechnic artillery activates and launches dizzying array of shells into the sky painting mile tall temple of light and fury onto the canvas of reality in pillar of grandeur we do the traditional thang and immediately have our first dance under deluge of photons then everything goes silent the lights fade from the sky and the amphitheater splits in two opening outward until each half has made full degree rotation and providing an unobstructed view of the mirrored pyramid the entire central venue guest area and dais roll out through the opening as the attendant crowd is allowed to stream into the cathedral behind them and then filter around to the sides of the venue in front of each amphitheater half kaleidoscope of lasers suddenly begins to ricochet off the reflective pyramid cutting galactic battle scene through the ceiling of smoke we hop on matching sport bikes and ride towards the pyramid as the symphony performs the grandest rendition of danger zone in history as we near the pyramid the lasers intensify and the pyramid separates to reveal launch platform and our personal rocket yacht we load up and blast off to our zero honeymoon leaving the masses to revel in our wake sure it really important that your

6841,throwaway time first off sell weed it how we became friends in the first place we were gonna start an llc for film company with couple other friends we both attended film school and helped him with pre pro production and ton in post on his film then when it comes time to make the company he goes and does all the paper work secretly behind my back and invites the other friends we were making the company with to sign all the papers and purposely leave me out one of the other friends who signed it with him also owed me for ounces fronted him so he could sell it this agreement had been going on for few months where would front him and he would pay me back later once he had sold it few days later still in the dark about why was left out of the signing just asked him why did so and so have to sign and not me helped with way more than he did the reply he gave me was so condescending all he said was you re drug dealer can not have you part of it the guy was fronting to all of sudden had no money to pay me for the front and his excuse was people are being really jewish not spending money around christmas this was literally what he said right before asked about why did not sign any papers was so disgusted by the lies and manipulation just got up and left saying after all did for you go fuck yourselves year later hear around school he telling people went crazy and threatened to kill him and his entire family literally have not said word to him since left his apartment about months before had to actually go to his brother who was still selling weed to and had no idea me and his brother were not talking anymore and tell him to cut it out or would be forced to sue him for defamation the friend who was selling my fronted weed still has not paid me they also claim they told me before but when asked when they cite time where we all collectively smoked grams so we could go eat so much we pass out also fronted the one friend an ounce before this it was supposedly talked about during the meal they said the reason do not remember is because had seizure from some mushrooms they had bought when saw them later they were as black as night and moldy it was one of the most disgusting excuses had ever heard if they had been upfront about it from the beginning would not have problem but they used me and said nothing just to fuck me over in the end they wanted me to stop selling completely at time when there was no revenue coming in basically telling me to throw away year for nothing would have no problem not selling anymore if there was form of revenue for me to pay my bills and rent but this was not the case and they knew full well that how paid my bills my plan was to stop once there was money coming in but they wanted to make the decision for me like they were morally superior and leave me to struggle with no income the kicker is once all this happened they tried to get documentary funded about medical marijuana for use on ptsd asking for literally half million for the entire project it failed spectacularly but the level of hypocrisy can not be made up just also want to add the reason you form an llc is to separate personal assets from the companies so even if something happened to me it would not affect the company whenever tell this story to my banker friend he just gets mad at how dumb of an excuse they used tldr friends fucked me out of company helped with more than anyone over me selling weed even though they knew before any talk of the company and the whole time they said would be part of it then they made disgusting excuses for themselves and spread completely false rumors about me after the fact,1,0,0,0.39729354510739606

7956,here is the original story was in the navy we were often tasked to repaint various parts of the submarine to prevent rust was told to repaint part of the engine room lower level bilge hate painting so naturally painted bunch of dicks the paint was the same color so they were mostly unnoticeable turns out that year or so later when another dude got assigned to paint the same spot he chose not to paint but reported that he was finished his division officer did spot check and noticed the preponderance of phallic hieroglyphs and assumed he did it he kept saying that he did not do it but then he had to admit that he had not painted he was busted down from to and restricted to the boat for days he had to paint every bilge in the engine room by himself luckily they did not remember who had painted last because the guy who had assigned it to me the last time was already gone was also gone by that point but buddy of mine relayed the story to me did not confess edit fixed formatting,0,0,1,2.526930336112464

8725,why does it have to be pre existing city could we possibly build new city for that purpose much like how washington was it would have to be somewhere near the confluence of trade and diplomacy would be strongest which would mean it would be in an ocean perhaps an island in the atlantic such as the azores or in the pacific like one of the many polynesian islands the city primary purpose would be governance and services to assist in that purpose however since it would be populated by elected officials and their staff large portion of its residents would be temporary staying only for their term of office this would probably create an unusual culture within the city where friendships outside of work are temporary at best the city would also need another purpose too in order to sustain it tourism may help but it would not provide the complete revenue to maintain its infrastructure since it would be on an island either manmade or natural then it could have industries that use ocean based resources fish and kelp farming would be good start and since also assuming this is in the near future then there would be mining operations to harvest manganese nodules from the ocean bed petroleum or shale mining can produce significant revenue as well the city can generate power from several sources tidal harnesses nuclear power solar collectors even geothermal taps are just few examples,1,0,1,0.08176066777294382

8811,the majority of people are feminists because they believe in the core tenets of the feminist movement they believe that women should have the same rights as men and that society still has patriarchic know mras do not like that word but it true mindset even if it not overtly expressed eg the notion that women should do stuff to please their partners while men are only expected not to irritate theirs which negatively affects both genders not just women the subconscious intuition that women are not fit to be in position of power or are less competent in certain jobs than men which affects women career opportunities the notion that men must be masculine and not showing emotion means you are stronger which again affects both men and women the double standard even if only subconsciously internalized when talking about promiscuity where women who sleep around are sluts and men who do the same are studs the more than obvious over sexualization of women in mass media etc etc sorry for the rant there not saying that the majority of people participate in the feminism movement they do not saying that the majority of the population identifies as feminist or egalitarian if you prefer when asked and this includes most men are you saying that good deal of the majority of the population which includes lots of men hate men what you want to do is equate feminism with the mra movement saying that they both have their crazies that true but you re ignoring the fact that many mras are sexist while almost none of the feminists hate men you know who feminists really hate sexists not an accusation against you just lighthearted joke,0,0,3,0.5890356777877509

10050,it shame how little the public school system cares about its students from what every teacher has told me once you get to college the environment is thousand times better my hs sociology teacher really down to earth guy who does not buy into all of the college hype told us we should at least consider it because the flexibility of setting your own schedule and the general pace and feel of things makes huge difference compared to high school my biggest complaint with high school as said in my original comment is that teachers have zero respect for your time on winter break at the moment and have huge ass book to read college kids are off for two more weeks and have no responsibilities because their classes have ended even when get break it really not break it just less work the saddest part is that can not figure out why some teachers do this sort of thing they are not bad people they actually think it helping they know the stress it puts us under they know we only do it for the grades they know whatever packet they make us do or book they make us read will ultimately have no impact on our education it incredibly frustrating when you have these excellent and incredibly nice people beat you over the head with so much work it brings you to tears fear it only going to get worse for high school students duel enrollment will be the next ap class for people wanting to go to college it used to be that ap classes were only for the best of the best now any schmuck whose parents want their baby to go to an ivy league can get put into one as long as the parents sign off my ap classes are absolutely massive now and are just as overcrowded as the rest of the school however very small pocket of those ap kids are being shipped off on school bus few times week to local university for duel enrollment courses once the rest of the country catches on it over the kids going to college will be all caught up in that business as you said it already an uphill battle to get into mid tier school guess what it only getting higher from here do not even blame the colleges for this mess it societal problem at some point in the past years america decided everyone needed to go to college because our system is broken at its core this is the result rather than college being place for higher education where people who loved learning and did well in school could attend it now where society expects you to go colleges are being forced to be more selective than ever every single day ranting at this point just hope everyone on all sides comes to their senses,0,0,1,1.3349737698250852

10875,mfw you say you are here some advice from yo do not give crap about filler curses in your last years study for the bac sats because that what matters if you do get shitty grades there look for uni with an entrance exam since they usually do not care about grades get really drunk one time slowly over the course of few hours slow with someone you trust that way you will know the signs of you starting to get drunk and be able to stop ve seen people keep drinking because they had no idea what their limit was then pass out on bench in the middle of winter if when you get drunk with friends stop drinking immediately because there will already be alcohol in your body to keep you drunk for while get some exercise going it easy in hs because your parents will always remind you to do it ve been trying to pick up running again for month now and keep forgetting games tv shows will always be there unique events will not go to birthdays go to parties and spend time with your family the pause button is there for reason if you play online games with cash shops lol csgo do not pay dime for skins because eventually you will quit want to quit and skins just make it harder because you have an interest now find hobby something physical an instrument sport whatever but something that you keep you entertained for long periods of time blackouts or lack of internet is thing and as gamer that usually kills my source of entertainment read find genre you like tv shows movies are great and all but there is lot of stories out there that are really cool but nobody touches them because it would be too expensive acne sucks deal with it remedies from professional makeup companies did not do shit for me instead found this weird ointment that some pharmacist made in small batches and that did wonders try stuff and you will probably find what you need avoid jager at all costs learning to make cocktails makes you seem really cool probably because it is really cool drugs are fun and all but being ruled by them is awful avoid the hard stuff and make sure you use the light stuff in moderation,0,0,0,0.8170026072652448
